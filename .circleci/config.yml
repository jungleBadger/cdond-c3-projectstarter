### It's a good practice to keep your commands at the top of the config file. In this project, you'll need at least 2 commands:

commands:
  npm-install:
    parameters:
      end:
        type: string
    steps:
      - run:
          name: Install parameters.end dependencies
          command: |
            cd << parameters.end >>
            npm i

#   destroy-environment:
#     description: Destroy backend and frontend cloudformation stacks given a workflow ID.
#     ...

#   revert-migration:
#     description: Revert the last migration if successfully run in the current workflow.
#     ...

jobs:
  build-frontend:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node
    steps:
      - checkout
      - npm-install:
          end: frontend
      - run:
          name: Building Frontend
          command: |
            cd frontend && npm run build

  build-backend:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node
    steps:
      - checkout
      - npm-install:
          end: backend
      - run:
          name: Building Backend
          command: |
            cd backend && npm run build
